      Ladies and gentlemen! I must tell you this.... We are going to have a
      great many toasts and speeches. Don't let's wait, but begin at once.
      Ladies and gentlemen, the newly married!

      DASHENKA kiss each other.]

      Beautiful! Beautiful! I must say, ladies and gentlemen, giving honour
      where it is due, that this room and the accommodation generally are
      splendid! Excellent, wonderful! Only you know, there's one thing we
      haven't got--electric light, if I may say so! Into every country electric
      light has already been introduced, only Russia lags behind.

      Electricity... h'm.... In my opinion electric lighting is just a
      swindle.... They put a live coal in and think you don't see them! No, if
      you want a light, then you don't take a coal, but something real,
      something special, that you can get hold of! You must have a fire, you
      understand, which is natural, not just an invention!
    </p>

    <h5 class="yats">YATS.</h5>
    <p class="speech">
      If you'd ever seen an electric battery, and how it's made up, you'd think
      differently.

    <h5 class="zhigalov">ZHIGALOV.</h5>
    <p class="speech">
      Don't want to see one. It's a swindle, a fraud on the public.... They want
      to squeeze our last breath out of us.... We know then, these... And, young
      man, instead of defending a swindle, you would be much better occupied if
      you had another yourself and poured out some for other people--yes!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      I entirely agree with you, papa. Why start a learned discussion? I myself
      have no objection to talking about every possible scientific discovery,
      but this isn't the time for all that!

      They want to show how educated they are, and so they always talk about
      things we can't understand.
