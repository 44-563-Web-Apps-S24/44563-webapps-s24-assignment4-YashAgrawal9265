      You can't go on like this! Where are you off to? What about the grand
      ronde? Grand ronde, s'il vous plait!

    <p class="speech">You had much better be dancing than upsetting me with your speeches.</p>

    <h5 class="aplombov">APLOMBOV.</h5>
    <p class="speech">
      I'm not a Spinosa or anybody of that sort, to go making figures-of-eight
      with my legs. I am a serious man, and I have a character, and I see no
      amusement in empty pleasures. But it isn't just a matter of dances. You
      must excuse me, maman, but there is a good deal in your behaviour which I
      am unable to understand. For instance, in addition to objects of domestic
      importance, you promised also to give me, with your daughter, two lottery
      tickets. Where are they?

    <h5 class="nastasya">NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</h5>
    <p class="speech">
      My head's aching a little... I expect it's on account of the weather....
      If only it thawed!
